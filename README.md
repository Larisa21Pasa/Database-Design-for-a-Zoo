# Database-Design-for-a-Zoo
The proposed system aims to efficiently manage the database for a zoological garden. It will feature detailed records for each animal, including general information such as name and birthdate. The system will standardize animal types to match existing enclosures, with each enclosure defined according to the animal type and, in some cases, including additional structures.

A key aspect of the system will be the management of animal diets. For each animal, details about the type of diet, its components, and required quantities will be recorded.

Additionally, the zoological garden has a specialized veterinary clinic that will maintain its own log for recording animal visits and treatments. This log will contain relevant medical information, including diagnoses, treatments, possible surgeries, and prescribed medications, along with the animal's birthdate and other details that may impact its care.

By implementing this record-keeping system, the project will ensure effective monitoring of animals and facilitate communication between departments.

This project was developed in the 4th year of university as a continuation of the ### Zoo-Animal-Management-System---SQL ###.
